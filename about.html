<p class="noindent">Every language has conventional and much-used ways of expressing even the most commonplace requests, inquiries, or responses. Some of these expressions are idioms or idiomatic. Others are perfectly understandable and literal English, but people unfamiliar with the language may have difficulty formulating them in typical and conventional ways. Derived from <em>NTC’s Dictionary of Everyday American English Expressions</em>, this book is a collection of nearly 5,000 such expressions grouped into 464 topics that are listed under 11 major categories of social interaction. New to this reference are extensive illustrations that place numerous expressions in a visual context, facilitating understanding and memorization.</p>
<p class="indent">The complete list of major category headings and their topics can be found in the <strong>Topic and Situation Index</strong>, beginning on page xi. This index can also be used for browsing through the topics. See a complete explanation of how to use this index on page xi. Each of the 464 topics has been assigned a number, and these numbers are the basis of the indexing systems. The numbers appear at the beginning of each topic heading in the body of the book to aid in finding a particular topic.<a id="page_viii"/></p>
